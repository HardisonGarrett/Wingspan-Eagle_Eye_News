                I graduated from Angelo State University in San Angelo Tx with a B.A in Communications. This is where I found my love for theater.<br>
                 This will be my 17th year of teaching theater in the public school system. I have taught Basic Theater, Advanced Theater, Technical<br>
                  Theater and now I also teach (Media Arts I) Basic Film Studies. Theater has become a passion for me and I hope to pass that on to my students.
